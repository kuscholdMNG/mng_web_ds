> **Updated 2026-10-30 (latest)**: P2 step 2, Latest Headlines + Latest Headlines List Item done. **Earlier, 2026-10-30:** P2 started: TopZone Article Card done. **Earlier, 2026-10-30:** Masthead for the other page types built in the Claude DS; P1 done. **Earlier, 2026-10-30 (later):** Masthead for the other page types added to P1 (Karl). **Earlier, 2026-10-30,** for P1 (Masthead, Footer, Ad Blocks): cleaned up in Figma, exported to `components/wordpress/` and **In system** in the Claude DS (Masthead: Page = Home). Status column below. Tracked in `MNG-Web-Design-System-Status.md`, open item 19.

## Context

The For You Hi-fi v4 prototype is now built only from the [MNG Web Design System](https://claude.ai/artifact/RKJ37zyXP7Wcvm1SDU7nzz) in Claude. Ten components it needs are still missing, so the prototype shows each one as a magenta placeholder labeled with the component name and Figma node.

- **Prototype:** [For You Tab MVP — Hi-fi v4](https://claude.ai/artifact/8C2rMAtGVyfqhtByzStWrr)
- **Export path for each component:** Figma (MNG Web Design System `jFHYqhZbJjvWQmDI4myCsd` / WordPress Elements `b1iZxkFwtAYq9rElmnCAzd`) → GitHub [kuscholdMNG/mng\_web\_ds](https://github.com/kuscholdMNG/mng_web_ds) (spec, tokens, skeleton, previews) → rebuild the Claude DS (`scripts/claude-design-system/build.py`).
- **Rule from the For You project:** Editor's Picks uses only the production (WordPress Elements) components; the For You tab uses only the Blocks components. Nothing missing gets hand-built in the prototype.

## P1: Page chrome (shows on every screen)

These three replace the biggest placeholders and bring back the masthead scroll behavior the project requires.

| Component | Figma | Variants and parts needed | Where it shows | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Masthead | WP Elements ▸ Menus and Parts `456:2572` (75 variants) | Page=Home, Default and Scrolled, at XL-Desktop, LG-TabletH, MD-TabletV, SM-Mobile, XS-Fold; subscriber (AdFree) and anonymous.

## P2: Editor's Picks zones

These fill the production homepage layout on the Editor's Picks tab. All are in WordPress Elements ▸ Homepage.

| Component | Figma | Notes | Where it shows | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TopZone Article Card | `3336:46079` | 4 cards in a 2×2 grid beside the Zone 1 lead; switches to thumbnail rows below 800px | Zone 1 | **Done 2026-10-30** (`TopZoneArticleCard`; 15px headline gap kept raw; Device renamed to production's ranges XS / S / M / L / XL; S added from production, Karl) |
| Latest Headlines + Latest Headlines List Item | `3476:62396`, `3336:46118` | 7 items with headline and time, plus a sponsored item; the Section Title / Eyebrow above it is already in the DS | Zone 1, right column | **Done 2026-10-30** (`LatestHeadlines`, `LatestHeadlinesListItem`; built to match production, Karl: time inline after the headline, 15/19 `color/gray/black` headline, S variant full width, title gap `font/theme/eyebrow-size`; Device = `XS (≤639px)`, `S (640–799px)`, `(≥800px)`. Newsletter Signup shows as a placeholder until step 3) |

| TOP ZONE Block | `3352:19482` | Assembly of the Zone 1 parts above | Zone 1 | Not started |

## P3 and deferred

None of these block the prototype today; each is a clean-up or a later need.

| Component | Figma | Why | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Related Article List Item | WP Elements `3334:43017` | Renders inside Zone 1 Lead Article Card today, built from the older export | Not started |
| Article Status Badge | WP Elements `3344:63995` | The Subscriber badge in 1Col Article Card uses the older export | Not started |
| Logo component | Newspaper Logos file `389:385` (190 variants) | Optional; the Placeholder Logos assets already cover the prototype | Not started |
| CheckBox | Web DS `4693:690` | Deferred: needed only if the For You onboarding steps come back | Not started |

## Already in the Claude DS (no work needed)

The prototype already mounts these real components:

- **For You tab:** Homepage Tabs, Section Title / Eyebrow, Tooltip (Toggletip), Blocks Lead Article Card (with Zone 1 Slideshow), Blocks Card, Blocks Article Row, Article Section Kicker / Author / Timestamp, Gallery Icon Badge, Show More Affordance, InLineMessage DashSubsNonSub, ModalsCenter, Button Primary, Button Modal Close, Icon.
- **Editor's Picks:** Zone 1 Lead Article Card, 1Col Article Card, Section Title / Eyebrow, Show More Affordance.
- **Foundations:** color tokens for Bold Coastal, Measured Vibrant and Modern Earthy, typography, spacing, radius, shadows, the icon font and the Placeholder Logos.

## Handing back to the For You project

A component is done when it shows as **In system** in the Claude DS inventory, with a README and a live preview card. Then the For You project:

1. Updates the design system install on the prototype canvas to the new DS version.
2. Swaps that component's magenta placeholders for the real component at every breakpoint.
3. For the Masthead, brings back the production scroll behavior (condensed sticky bar).

P1 first, then P2 in table order. Partial batches are fine; each export can be swapped in on its own.
